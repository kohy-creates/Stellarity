# Dragonblade

<div class="result kohara-infobox-grid" markdown>
<div markdown class="kohara-infobox-text">
The **Dragonblade** is a post-Dragon greatsword with the ability to trigger a powerful punch after hitting a mob 3 times. Punches deal heavy damage with high armor penetration, knock enemies back a great distance and temporarily stun them.

<i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-enchanting-table"></i> The Dragonblade can be enchanted with any Sword enchantment. Knockback enchantment further empowers its punch ability.

<i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-anvil"></i> The Dragonblade is unbreakable and cannot be repaired with an Anvil. However, <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-enchanted-book"></i>Enchanted Books can be fused with the Dragonblade to transfer enchantments.

## Obtaining
After defeating the Ender Dragon for the first time, the Dragonblade spawns stuck in the [Altar of The Accursed](../mechanics/altar_of_the_accursed). Right clicking it will cause it to drop, making it collectable.

Only one Dragonblade generates on each world.

## Usage
Attacking enemies inflicts Dragon Stacks. After 3 Stacks are inflicted, player can sneak while holding the Dragonblade to use all Stacks to perform a powerful punch. Stacks time out on their own after 16 seconds.

Punching warps affected entity 8.2 blocks away from the player, but stopping on any solid block. Punches deals 7:heart: х ₃.₅ base damage with 70% armor penetration.

Punched enemies will have Weakness I applied to them for 7 seconds, on top of being stunned for 1 second. Stunned mobs are unable to walk, but can still jump and attack. Additionaly, punched mob will be afflicted with [Voided I](../mechanics/status_effects#voided) for 10 seconds.

If an enemy is punched into any solid block, the damage is boosted to 24:heart: x ₁₂. The duration of Weakness is also increased to 11 seconds and stun duration to 2 seconds. Enemies nearby take 4:heart::heart: splash damage, while also being being inflicted with Weakness I for 3 seconds.

Each level of **Knockback enchantment** enchances punch distance by 1.1 blocks and punch damage, inceasing it by is +1.5:heart: ₓ ₀․₇₅, +4:heart::heart: and +1.5:heart: ₓ ₀․₇₅ per level for normal punch, wall punch and splash damage respectively.

Punched mobs cannot have stacks applied to them for the next 8 seconds, indicated by a cloud of dust above their head.

Punches receive only 40% of melee damage bonuses. Strength Potions do not increase punch damage, only boosting base weapon damage instead. 

The Dragonblade is unbreakable on top of being immune to lava, fire, explosions and cacti. Additionaly, it automatically returns to the Altar of The Accursed if dropped away from it, meaning that it is truly indestructible.

## Tips
- Dragonblade is slightly slower compared to other swords, so take that into consideration when timing your hits.
- Sweeping Edge allows the Dragonblade to apply Stacks to multiple enemies at once with the sweep attack.
- Knockback II <i class="icon-stellarity icon-stellarity-dragonblade"></i>Dragonblade deals 32:heart: х ₁₆ damage on block punches. Keep in mind that 70% of that damage ignores armor completely, meaning that mobs and players with unenchanted Netherite Armor and 20 health or less can die in a single punch.
- Because the Dragonblade is unbreakable, enchanting it with Unbreaking or Mending is redundant. Don't waste your Enchanted Books.
- Voided is inflicted **before** punch damages a mob. You can treat it as a separate damage instance worth 20% of your tartet's max health and 100% armor penetration.

## Trivia
- The method of obtaining the Dragonblade has changed throughout different Stellarity versions.
	- Upon its release in 1.5a, it was found stuck in the Altar of The Accursed, right after entering The End.
	- During the development of Indev-1.6a, it dropped from the Ender Dragon with a 50% chance.
	- However, due to a community poll, it returned to its one-per-world state, with the only difference being that it spawned after defeating the Ender Dragon for the first time, and not prior.
- Upon release, the `/loot give` command for the Draognblade would return a broken item which couldn't be used.
	- This was patched in v1.5b.
- The Dragonblade and its ability is based on the Kaliyah[^1] kit from Roblox BedWars[^2].
	- Its description is also a reference to Kaliyahkit description - `A fearsome warrior with a fiery punch!`.
	- The quoted line is a reference to Terraria's S.D.M.G.[^3] tooltip, `It came from the edge of space`.
- Prior to Indev-1.6a, it acted as an indirect upgrade to a Netherite Sword.
	- It had identical base stats, and instead of having a punch ability, it would spawn clouds of Dragon's Breath under attacked mobs and give its user Strength. This had a 5 second cooldown.
- During the development of vIndev-1.6a, it went through a total of 3 separate reworks.
	- First one was simply editing the Dragon's Breath cloud properties and an increase to base damage.
	- Second one was similair to current behavior, but the punch damage was always 22 and it had upward motion. It was also triggered on the 4th hit, rather than with sneaking.
	- Third and final one was what it is today.
- Dying to a Dragonblade's punch in PvP will result in one of a few custom death messages:
    1. `VICTIM was punched into the otherworld by PLAYER`.
    2. `VICTIM was punched a bit too hard by PLAYER`.
    3. `VICTIM was warped into another reality by PLAYER`.
- The Dragonblade is one of the 4 unbreakable items in Stellarity, the other 3 being [Ancient Wooden Sword](ancient_wooden_sword.md), a maxed out [Frigid Harvester](frigid_harvester.md) and [Kaleidoscope](kaleidoscope.md).
- The sound made when the Dragonblade is dropped is the sound made when the Obsidian Claymore[^4] drops in Minecraft: Dungeons.
- Ever since its rework in vIndev-1.6a, the Dragonblade has only seen 1 nerf - a minor reduction in the splash damage radius for block punches.
