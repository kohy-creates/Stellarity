# Ancient Wooden Sword

<div class="result kohara-infobox-grid" markdown>
<div markdown class="kohara-infobox-text">
**Ancient Wooden Sword** is an unobtainable sword which partially brings back 1.8 PvP mechanics, allowing players to spam click to attack. Its recipe was removed in Stellarity v2.0a, but it remains in the files and can still be obtained through the `/loot` command.

## Obtaining
Ancient Wooden Sword could be obtained by exhuming[^1] <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-wooden-sword"></i>Wooden Sword at an [Altar of The Accursed](../mechanics/altar_of_the_accursed.md). Result item kept all enchantments of the weapon used in the process.

## Usage
Ancient Wooden Sword has infinite Attack Speed attribute, meaning that it can be spam clicked to attack.

Altough it has quite potent attack speed, its damage value of only 4:heart::heart: makes it not nearly as powerful as other items obtainable at the same stage of progression.

## Tips
- There are no tips, as this item is unobtainable.
    - Go use the other items. You know, the ones you can actually get without cheating.

## Trivia
- The texture used for this weapon is the original pre-1.14 Programmer Art texture for a Wooden Sword...
    - ...which was also the texture it used from the very moment it got added up until the Texture Update in 1.14.
- The tooltip is kohara laughing at everyone who refuses to play modern versions of Minecraft simply because of the Combat Update.
    - During Indev-1.6a, its flavor text used to be `what do you mean I can't spam click???`, further mocking such behavior.
- This is one of the 4 unbreakable items in Stellarity, the other 3 being the [Dragonblade](../dragonblade.md), a maxed out [Frigid Harvester](../frigid_harvester.md) and [Kaleidoscope](../kaleidoscope.md).
- Despite being considered 'removed' since v2.0a, it got a single change in v2.1a.
