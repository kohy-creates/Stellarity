# Sariel

<div class="result kohara-infobox-grid" markdown>
<div markdown class="kohara-infobox-text">
**Sariel** was a post-Dragon dagger that could sometimes spawn healing orbs on enemy hits. Healing orbs would slowly fly towards the nearest player and heal them for 4:heart::heart:

<i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-enchanting-table"></i> Sariel could be enchanted with any Sword enchantment.

<i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-anvil"></i> Sariel could be repaired with <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-iron-ingot"></i>Iron Ingots.

## Obtaining
Sariel could be crafted at the [Altar of The Accursed](../mechanics/altar_of_the_accursed.md) by combining an <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-iron-sword"></i>Iron Sword, 5 <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-gold-ingot"></i>Gold Ingots and 10 <i class="icon-stellarity icon-stellarity-pixie-dust"></i>[Pixie Dust](materials/pixie_dust.md), meaning that in order to craft it, the player had to venture into [The Hallow](../biomes/the_hallow.md) first.

## Usage
After attacking any mob, there was an 18% chance that a Healing Orb would spawn. It would slowly fly towards the nearest player, healing them for 4:heart::heart: health. Up to 2 Healing Orbs could spawn at once, though only one would spawn most of the time.

| Number of Healing Orbs | Chance |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1 | 18% |
| 2 | 3.24% |

## Trivia
- Its name was a reference to [Sariel](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Sariel) - a charcater from Touhou Project game series.
    - Ironically, despite Sariel being a Death Angel in Touhou, the item itself dealt very little damage and focused on healing instead.
        - Its flavor text was the title of [Sariel's first theme](https://youtu.be/YiN9rqnxw20).
    - Sariels are also archangels, mainly from Judaic tradition.
- Healing Orbs moved a bit slower than player's running speed, but a bit faster than their walking speed.
- Sariel had went through a total of 7 changes to its healing chance during the development of 2.0a.
    - These were: `18%` -> `27%` -> `22%` -> `33%` -> `20%` -> `15%` -> `12%` -> `18%`.
- During some time in its development, the Healing Orbs used to slowly gain momentum as they flew.
- Upon initial release, instead of using 5 <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-gold-ingot"></i>Gold Ingots to craft it, a <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-wither-skeleton-skull"></i>Wither Skeleton Skull was used instead.
- During development it used to have a durability value of 777, which is a number symbolizing divine guidance.
