**Stella** is a post-Empress sword which applies Prismatic Inferno on hit. Unlike most DoT inflicting weapons, Stella can stack the damage of its flames up to 5 times and they last longer.

<i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-enchanting-table"></i> Stella can be enchanted with any Sword enchantment.

<i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-anvil"></i> Stella can be repaired with <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-netherite-ingot"></i>Netherite Ingots.
