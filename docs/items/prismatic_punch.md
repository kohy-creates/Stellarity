<div markdown class="kohara-infobox-text">
**Prismatic Punch** is a post-Empress crossbow that converts arrows into quick Prismatic Blasts which gain speed over time and explode upon coming into contact with anything.

<i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-enchantng-table"></i> Prismatic Punch can be enchanted with any Crossbow enchantment.

<i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-anvil"></i> Prismatic Punch can be repaired by fusing it with a different <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-crossbow"></i>Crossbow.

## Obtaining
Prismatic Punch has a 50% chance to be dropped by the [Empress of Light](../mobs/bosses/empress_of_light.md) if killed in The End or during nighttime.

## Usage
Prismatic Punch conevrts any loaded projectile into a powerful Prismatic Blast. Blasts are shot with initial velocity of 16 blocks per second, but accelerate by 4.8 b/s^2 until reaching top speed of 120 b/s. Blasts are unaffected by gravity and travel in a straight line.

When a Prismatic Blast collides with an entity or a block, it instantly explodes, dealing variable damage in a small area. All damaged mobs will be set on [Prismatic Inferno](../mechanics/status_effects.md#prismatic-inferno) for 3 seconds. Explosions don't destroy blocks. Blasts can explode multiple times with odds presented in the table below, with the average damage being 8.2:heart: ₓ ₄․₁.

| Explosion count | Total explosion damage | Chance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | 7:heart: ₓ ₃․₅ | 50% |
| 2 | 9:heart: ₓ ₄․₅ | 40% |
| 3 | 11:heart: ₓ ₅․₅ | 10% |

Multishot enchantment causes 2 smaller blasts to appear circling around the Blast is it travels, which create smaller explosions. Explosion count from the main blast is always 1, however it has a much larger radius and inflicts Prismatic Inferno for 5 seconds total.

Piercing enchantment causes the blast to be able to pierce through enemies and trigger explosions multiple times. If mobs are close to each other, then different explosions can hurt the same entity, stacking the damage.

## Tips 
- Prismatic Blasts are uncomparably quicker than Arrows and more reliable on large distances. Combining this with the fact that Blasts deal AoE damage, meaning that shots don't need to be perfectly accurate, makes the Prismatic Punch an excellent weapon for sniping targets from afar.
- Use regular Arrows with this weapon, since it converts ALL ammo into Blasts. Using Spectral/Tipped Arrows is a waste of ammo.
- Explosions can hurt <u>you</u> if you stand too close to your target. Keep your distance.
- Explosions from Prismatic Punch ignore invulnerability frames.
- With Multishot, remember that only the main blast has increased radius. Enemies further away from the center of the explosion won't take full explosion damage. However, they will still be burned for the same duration.

## Trivia
- This is first Developer Item to have ever been added into Stellarity, and also the first item to lose that status.
- This is the second Crossbow to get added, first being the [Clockwork Crossbow](clockwork_crossbow.md).
- The color palette is based on the colors of the trans pride flag[^1].
    - They are also a reference to colors of one of the weapons in Terraria, the [Last Prism](https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Last_Prism).
- During its development, Prismatic Punch was craftable at the [Altar of The Accursed](../mechanics/altar_of_the_accursed.md) by using a <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-crossbow"></i>Crossbow, 24 <i class="icon-stellarity icon-stellarity-pixie-dust"></i>[Pixie Dust](materials/pixie_dust.md) and 6 <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-diamond"></i>Diamonds, however this was quickly removed in favor of making it obtainable from the Empress of Light.
	- However, this wasn't actually implemented until a lot later, making the item unobtainable for that period.
- Despite not requiring to be loaded with Spectral Arrows, its loaded texture shows it being loaded with one.
	- The same texture is also used for when it's loaded with a <i class="icon-minecraft icon-minecraft-firework-rocket"></i>Firework Rocket.
